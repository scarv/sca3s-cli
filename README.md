# [SCA3S](https://github.com/scarv/sca3s): command-line interface

<!--- -------------------------------------------------------------------- --->

*Acting as a component part of the wider
[SCARV](https://www.scarv.org)
project,
SCA3S is a collection of resources that support the development 
and analysis of cryptographic implementations wrt.
[side-channel attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack):
SCA3A is, more specifically, pitched as offering
"side-channel analysis as a service":
it allows users to acquire and analyse side-channel data-sets which stem 
from execution of their implementation, without (necessarily) owning or 
operating the associated infrastructure.
Mirroring the goals of SCARV, it places particular emphasis on analogue 
side-channels (e.g., power and EM) stemming from
[RISC-V](https://riscv.org)-based
platforms.
The main
[repository](https://github.com/scarv/sca3s)
acts as a general container for associated resources;
this specific submodule houses
a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) which allows interaction with the front-end infrastructure *without* using the web-based UI.
